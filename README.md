A simple assembler with JAVA graphical interface and my own assembler language. The repo also contains a Hungarian documentation, with the list of the commands. An English one will be added. If you have questions, contact me antal[dooot]janos[dooot]benjamin[aaat]gmail[dooot]com.

You can see three examples, that can help you to understand the language, if you can't read the Hungarian documentation.
